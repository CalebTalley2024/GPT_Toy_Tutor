While they have correctly subtracted the tens and ones place values, their explanation of how they got their answer is a little convoluted.\\n\\nThe actual answer to the problem of 'What is 67 minus 32?' is 35. To get this answer, you would subtract the ones place value (7-2 = 5) and then the tens place value (6-3=3). This gives you 35 as the difference between the two numbers.\\n\\nYour student's answer is correct but their explanation involves adding 60 and 7 before subtracting 30 and 2, which isn't necessary for this problem. It's important for your student to understand the steps in subtraction and use them consistently, avoiding unnecessary steps.\"\n",
