## Questions
- what if the studnet wants to go back another level
	- allow the studnet to either have a suggested level, or the ability to pick the level for themselves?
- grades are off
- should we hold previous scores?
- what if the student gets lucky
- How to accurately measure time
- do we want students to be able to pick different levels
	- they might lose some skills along the way
	- they only need to complete 3 questions
## Current Problems
- grades are inaccurate , 
	- computation
		- sometimes the math is just straight up wrong
	- wrong if you get question right, but your reasoning is off
		- `Therefore, the correct answer is x = 4. The student incorrectly stated that 8/2 = 4, which is not true. The correct simplification is 8/2 = 4.`
- Whent he student has a perfect score for a section, they are asked to pick a different topic
- What to do for questions that dont really need that much of an explanation
	- 1 + 1 is 2, 
		- what do you even need to explain
- Writing nothing gets you too high of a scroe
- says you get the wrong answer, even if the answer is correct
- the database update fails if the user visits the application multiple times
- give the user the chance to ask multiple questions
 
## Future Changes
- add a way for studnets to see what common mistakes they make on a topic before getting the questions
- add the possibility of adding more questions to test
- weighting the metrics differently
